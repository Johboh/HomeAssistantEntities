   * subscribing to a state. This is also the path key used under the MQTT
   * "homeassistant/<component>/<node_id>" path for publishing the configuration. Example for a state topic for
   * a temperature for bathroom: "bathroom" which will lead to state topic "bathroom/sensor/temperature/state", and the
   * Home Assistant Configuration will be published under "homeassistant/sensor/bathroom/temperature/config" Valid
   * characters are [a-zA-Z0-9_-] (machine readable, not human readable)
   * @param json_this_device_doc Information about this device. The device is this hardware that have all the Home
   * Assistant entities. A device is not required. If there is a device, the name displayed in the UI will be the device
   * name combined with the entity name. See
   * https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#entity-naming for more
   * information. All these keys will be added to a "device" key in the Home Assistant configuration for each entity.
   * Only a flat layout structure is supported, no nesting. This is called from the setup function below before we setup
   * the remote. set to empty document if no device information should be set.
   * @param verbose True to do extra debug logging and printouts.
   * @package abbreviations True to use abbreviations for the MQTT payload. This will make payload smaller, but less
   * readable.

   * "unit_of_measurement" or whatever is needed in the Configuration for the specific entity.

   * For more information, see https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery

   * is. Examples are "sensor", "binary_sensor", "cover", "light", etc.

   * your door, but if you have two locks, you want to add a child object ID to them. By setting the child_object_id to
